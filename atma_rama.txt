Mic check, mic check
Yeah, the mic alright? Thanks a lot
Uh, yo
It's Brodha V
Some of you might have heard of me
I talk about money, I talk about rap music
I talk about getting high
But now, I'ma talk about God
Back in the time when I was lacking a dime
My hopeless youth had me slowly get attracted to crime
Then sat an alliance to talk it out with practical minds
Felt a force within me, get all my talents combined
Enacted a mime, enlightened, I decided to rhyme
Delighted and excited, I'm planning to rap 'til I'm prime
Started spilling ink on the paper and planned to get signed
But the world is biased, so wild, they got me slapped with a fine
Never got a chance, never let me spit on the mic
Only 'cause I come from a land where people ain't white
Day and night, I keep flowing, completing all my demo tracks
In spite being denied the right by anti-democrats
Unleash my rage through music intense
The cultural shock that got my whole community tensed
That's when I close my eyes and talk to God
Peace in my head, I'm singing this song, and it goes like
